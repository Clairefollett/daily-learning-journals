#LJ Code 201 - Day 5

Day 5 is the day that we deployed our about me projects. Unfortunately, I turned in mine like an hour ago so it was turned in pretty late. I am really thankful for Johnny though because he took the time out of his days off to help me break down the class labs and understand what every function and method is doing and why.
