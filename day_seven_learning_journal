# LJ Code 201 - Day 3

I'm trying to catch up on all of the readings and the journals, I spend all of my time working on the class assignments and trying to figure them out so most days, I don't even think about making a journal entry. I've read a lot of material in the books but I haven't taken the time to write a summary about each chapter on canvas. I feel SO LUCKY to have a week off of school, I'm going to review all of the material and hopefully meet up with other people from the class and study. I think the thing I am struggling with most right now is that I am more of a hands-on learner and a visual learner so when Aaron is teaching us new concepts, sometimes it's hard for me to follow along unless I am doing what he is doing on my computer. For example, if he's reviewing the lab from the day before, I will open up atom and do what he does and take notes. I'm incredibly grateful for Johnny and Stephanie, they have helped me and supported me a lot. And Aaron too of course. But yeah, I'm going to take the week break to catch up on everything and to practice all of the concepts we have learned. I really love learning about javascript and HTML/CSS, I love problem solving and being able to figure out certain projects and being able to see the progress and the final result. It's just really challenging, and sometimes, it doesn't really make sense. You just have to keep pushing and trying even when you feel like throwing your laptop against the wall. I quit smoking cigarettes in July but I smoke on the breaks a lot here and lunch just because I'm generally more stressed when I'm here. I mean which isn't a bad thing, I think it's good that I'm doing something that I really love and that stresses me out. Nothing in life is easy if it's worth it.
