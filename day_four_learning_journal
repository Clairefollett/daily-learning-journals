# LJ Code 201 - Day 4

Thursday was a really good day. I enjoyed the pair programming, it was nice to have somebody check over my code and give me suggestions and advice. I'm trying to catch up on the reading right now, I think the textbooks really help explain details of certain concepts. I'm excited that I have almost finished my first week of 201, even though it can be really challenging and frustrating at times, I do really love the material that we are learning and it gets more exciting everyday! I think the biggest thing I struggle with is trying to do everything at once instead of trying to break it down into parts and assigning code to each part of the problem.
