#LJ Code 201 - Day 4

On day 4 in class, we worked on our about_me projects and that was the day we had a partner and turned all of our functions into constructor functions I think, I can't remember the assignment exactly. Kevin was my partner and it's funny because he is also in my final project group, we are making the hang-man game. Thinking about the first week compared to now, I have learned a tremendous amount and I am a lot more confident with coding and javascript.
