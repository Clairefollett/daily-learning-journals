#LJ Code 201 - Day 8

This is the day we started the salmon cookie project. I was actually just touching this project up as well, I just need to add some more styling and it should be ready to submit. I can remember feeling very overwhelmed the first day this project was introduced but I feel a lot more confident now since we went over it in class and Johnny also went over this project with me. I learned a lot from this assignment and I'm glad I was able to get the help that I needed and that I didn't give up.
