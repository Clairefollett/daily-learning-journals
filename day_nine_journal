#LJ Code 201 - Day 9

Day 9 was when we worked on the styling of our cookie stand project. That is actually what I am currently doing right now, I'm just putting the finishing touches on it and making sure all the images look beautiful. I am trying to work on taking less time with css, I try to make it as perfect as I can and end up spending hours on it when I could be spending a lot less time on it and still make it look good and presentable.
