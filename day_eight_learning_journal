#LJ Code 201 - Day 8

Wow! What a week so far. I feel like I'm learning A TON and I still missed a lot of concepts that I should review. I'm really happy that we have a whole week of break to catch up on things, I think that will be really helpful. I'm tying to make a plan for the days on break so I can turn in all of the readings and go back and fix my labs and journals and everything. I was talking to Aaron yesterday about how I struggle with taking what needs to be done and turning it into code, like which methods I should use and variables and everything. I think it's just something that takes a lot of practice and I just need to keep working on it. I can be pretty hard on myself when it comes to school and learning stuff and I always try to remind myself that this is challenging for everybody, I'm not the only one who is confused and who gets stuck from time to time. We are almost half way down, how exciting!
