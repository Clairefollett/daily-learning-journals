# LJ Code 201 - Day 3

Boy oh boy, what a day. I keep trying to work on my class assignment so I can upload it to the canvas but every time I'm working on it, my computer freezes after like five minutes. It was doing the exact same thing in class. I'm almost done with the class assignment anyways, I just have to tune some things up but every time I try to open my guessing game on chrome, that's where it gets stuck I think. My computer is working fine now but I only have atom and the terminal open right now. I'm not even going to try to open chrome, I'm going to use Safari to upload this. Today was definitely really challenging and complicated at times but I'm glad that I pushed through it and was honest about needing help. I feel kind of embarrassed because I'm the one that always asks so many questions and is always confused but then again, I don't really care hahaha I overcame a lot to get here and I'm going to make sure I learn the material. I think I can get overwhelmed pretty easily, when I came back from lunch, I was getting so anxious and stressed out looking at all of the directions for lab and trying to figure out how to write it into code so I decided to take a break and walk around the building a few times. I talked to my dad too and he helped re-assure me that it's okay to need help and to ask questions, this stuff is going to be confusing and intense until we practice it and get the hang of it. Anyways, I'm just kind of worried about not turning in the class assignment and I don't know why it keeps freezing up like that. I definitely think it's chrome but that's what the terminal goes to when I try to open up my guessing game and there are a couple of things I need to touch up so I don't know what to do. I'm just going to ask one of you guys tomorrow during lab and get it turned in.
