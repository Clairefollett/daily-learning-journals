#LJ Code 201 - Day 10

It looks like this way the day that we worked on the chocolate pizza wire frame project in partners and we turned our cookie stand project. Well, technically I am still working on my cookie stand project but it was due on day 10. My partner for the chocolate pizza assignment was Will and we worked really well together. I didn't know I had to deploy it and I accidentally turned it in late. But all in all, I learned a lot from that experience and it was nice to shift to CSS for a couple of days!
