# LJ Code 201 - Day 1

Omg, I finally figured it out! Here I am! Well, hello journal. This is my first entry obviously which is pretty exciting. I have a problem with getting overwhelmed really easily so I try to come to class in a really good mind set and I try to ask questions when I need to and I always take notes. The first day of class was really good but it was also challenging at certain points. I'm a very curious person and I always wonder "why?" and with the speed of this course, sometimes you don't have time to ask "why?" All in all though, I did learn a great deal today about managing files and creating new repositories and directories. I was definitely really confused at first and I feel a lot more confident about it now. I think I just didn't understand that the terminal and github and atom are all connected with one another. I also have a hard time remembering things, I have a really poor short term memory, so I ask a lot of clarifying questions and it helps a lot. I really like my classmates and my instructor and the TA and I'm excited to dive into the material. I really wish I went to the pre-course last week, I signed up for it but ended up having to miss the first two days of it because I was house sitting and so I just decided that I was going to go through some of the exercises on codecademy to refresh my mind and go over things that were a little more complex and confusing.
